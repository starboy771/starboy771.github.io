            <img src="image/mps3.png" alt="step 3 image" height="400" width="600">
            <p>Next, make "main", then a "div" so that you can put a title for your header. Use the "paragraph (p)" tool to put down your webpages information. Make sure to close the div before you make another one.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Step 4 of webpage template</p>
            <img src="image/mps4.png" alt="step 4 image" height="500" width="700">
            <p>Next, you make another div for your images. Your going to need to make multiple divs, depending on how many images you're going to put in. After putting in the div, you should use the "img" tool, put down the image source in the "src" section, and the alternate name for the image in the "alt" section. In order for the image to show, you need to put in the height and width of the image. It's advised to mess with the width and height until the image looks good and easy to see.</p>
