                <h3>The Importent Points of Pokemon</h3>
                <p>A Pokemon trainer starts their Pokeon journey by getting their first Pokemon from the Pokemon labs in their towns.</p>
                <p>Once obtaining their first Pokemon, trainers will use their Pokemon to battle wild Pokemon to weaken them enough to capture them.</p>
                <p>Once a Pokemon is captured, it'll be bound to you until you willingly let it go. A trainer can only carry six Pokemon at a time. Any extra Pokemon captured are placed in a PC that you can check at in Pokemon centers.</p>
                <p>Other trainers will battle you for fun and it's a good why to strenghthen your Pokemon.</p>
                <p>Pokemon Centers are used as a place to heal your Pokemon if it's badly damaged.</p>
